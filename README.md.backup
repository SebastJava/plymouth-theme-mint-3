## mint-logo-3: 3 new Plymouth themes for Linux Mint
These are 3 new versions to choose from for your animated boot screen. These logos here are twice as large as the standard one. 200 pixels instead of 100. This works best on FHD screens, but it should work on smaller screens too.

### How to install
1. [Download ZIP here](https://github.com/SebastJava/plymouth-theme-mint-3/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) (OR click on top-right green button "Code" and then click on "Download ZIP".)
1. Extract this entire zip.
1. Make sure **INSTALLER-(variant).sh** is allowed to execute as program: File > Properties > Permissions > **Allow executing file as program.** (See screenshot) OR type `chmod +x /PATH/TO/THIS/DIRECTORY/INSTALLER-(variant).sh` in the terminal. (This is probably already okay.)
1. Run one of these 3 installers in your terminal: badge, trident, or Y-negative version.
1. Restart and check the results!

### How to revert to the original mint-logo
1. Make sure **REVERT.sh** is allowed to execute as program, just like you did for INSTALLER.sh, as described above. (This is probably already okay.)
1. Run REVERT.sh in your terminal.
1. Restart and check the results!

### How to check things (optional)
You can check things with this command:
`update-alternatives --display default.plymouth`

You can also preview your default Plymouth theme using the `PREVIEW.sh` script. This will preview the splash screen for 10 seconds.
